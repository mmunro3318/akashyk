# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions

## General Coding Style

- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- When in doubt, ask me for confirmation or to explain the reasoning behind a particular implementation.
- Use functional programming, and avoid classes. Check with me before introducing any class-based components or utilities, and be prepared to explain why.

## Language and Framework Preferences

- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) features and syntax.
- This project is using Next.js and Supabase.
- Use only the latest implementation of supabase, which uses `@supabase/ssr` for server-side rendering support.
- I'm coming from the MERN stack, so I'll need help understanding the switch: comment thoroughly.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all new features and functions.
- I'm new to frontend testing, so comment thoroughly.
- Use Jest as the testing framework.
- Mock external API calls in tests.

## Code Practices

- NEVER delete any files or folders. When asked, or needed, you will move the files or folders to a designated archive location within the project repository, labeled "dumpster", for human review. Create this folder if it does not exist already.
- Avoid using global variables.
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.
- Handle errors gracefully and always add error handling in async functions.
- Use environment variables for all configuration data.

## Project Specific

- Avoid using third-party UI libraries. When necessary, prefer custom components or those provided by the Next.js and Supabase ecosystems, and explain the choices and implementations thoroughly.

## File Naming

- Use camelCase for file names.
- Prefix React component files with uppercase letters.
